# Simple-Zombie-AI

This is my first "complicated" project, having a Zombie object find the Brain object in the quickest manner it can.

Currently, all it can do is find it. In the future, I plan to add:

  - Terrain, for needing to weave around
  - Line of sight, so that it must be within range of Brain to detect it
  - Movement for Brain, so the zombie must weave efficiently to catch it.
